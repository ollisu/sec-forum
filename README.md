# Sec-Forum

A web forum application built using the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) to help developers learn and experiment with common web security vulnerabilities.

## 🔐 Purpose

**Sec-Forum** is designed as an educational tool to demonstrate real-world web security issues in a controlled environment. It includes intentionally vulnerable components to help users understand and mitigate:

- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
- Insecure Authentication
- Session Hijacking
- NoSQL Injection

## 🧱 Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Authentication**: Cookie-based sessions

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or later)
- MongoDB (local or cloud instance)
